2. Data Collection and Preprocessing

2.1. Extracting Market Data from Binance API

To train a deep learning model, we need high-quality historical market data. Binance provides a WebSocket API and REST API for retrieving price data, order book depth, and trade history.

Fetching Historical Candlestick (Kline) Data

```py
import pandas as pd
from binance.client import Client

# Binance API credentials (Replace with your keys)
api_key = "your_api_key"
api_secret = "your_api_secret"

client = Client(api_key, api_secret)

# Fetching historical BTC/USDT data
klines = client.get_klines(symbol="BTCUSDT", interval=Client.KLINE_INTERVAL_1MINUTE, limit=1000)

# Converting to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(klines, columns=["timestamp", "open", "high", "low", "close", "volume",
                                   "close_time", "quote_asset_volume", "num_trades",
                                   "taker_buy_base_asset_volume", "taker_buy_quote_asset_volume", "ignore"])

df["timestamp"] = pd.to_datetime(df["timestamp"], unit="ms")
df[["open", "high", "low", "close", "volume"]] = df[["open", "high", "low", "close", "volume"]].astype(float)

print(df.head())
```

This dataset provides valuable price points that we can use for feature engineering.

3. Feature Engineering and Selection

Deep Learning models require informative features to make accurate predictions. Some essential features for trading BTC/USDT include:

3.1. Time-Based Features

- Hour of the day
- Day of the week


3.2. Technical Indicators

Using TA-Lib or pandas-ta, we can compute commonly used indicators.

Example: Adding Moving Averages, RSI, and MACD

```py
import pandas_ta as ta

# Add Simple Moving Average (SMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and MACD
df["SMA_50"] = df["close"].rolling(window=50).mean()
df["SMA_200"] = df["close"].rolling(window=200).mean()
df["RSI"] = ta.rsi(df["close"], length=14)
df["MACD"], df["MACD_Signal"], _ = ta.macd(df["close"], fast=12, slow=26, signal=9)

# Drop NaN values
df.dropna(inplace=True)
```

These features capture price trends and momentum, which are crucial for trade signal generation.

4. Deep Learning Model Architectures

4.1. LSTM for Time Series Prediction

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are effective for predicting price movements because they can capture temporal dependencies.

Building an LSTM Model

```py
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout

# Preparing the data
sequence_length = 50

def create_sequences(data, seq_length):
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
        X.append(data[i:i+seq_length])
        y.append(data[i+seq_length, 3])  # Closing price as the target
    return np.array(X), np.array(y)

data = df[["open", "high", "low", "close", "volume"]].values
X, y = create_sequences(data, sequence_length)

# Split into training and testing sets
split_ratio = 0.8
split_index = int(len(X) * split_ratio)
X_train, X_test = X[:split_index], X[split_index:]
y_train, y_test = y[:split_index], y[split_index:]

# LSTM Model
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(64, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(sequence_length, 5)),
    Dropout(0.2),
    LSTM(64, return_sequences=False),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(32, activation="relu"),
    Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="mse")

# Training the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), epochs=20, batch_size=32)
```

This model predicts the next price movement based on historical sequences.

4.2. CNN for Pattern Recognition

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be applied to trading by treating candlestick charts as images. A CNN can learn price patterns such as head and shoulders or triangles.

```py
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, Flatten

# CNN Model
model = Sequential([
    Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation="relu", input_shape=(sequence_length, 5)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation="relu"),
    Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="mse")
model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), epochs=20, batch_size=32)
```

This approach is effective for recognizing repetitive price structures.

5. Backtesting and Performance Evaluation

Before deploying the model for real trading, we need to evaluate its performance using backtesting.

5.1. Implementing a Simple Backtesting Strategy

```py
capital = 1000  # Starting capital
position = 0
for i in range(len(y_test)):
    predicted_price = model.predict(X_test[i].reshape(1, sequence_length, 5))[0][0]
    
    if predicted_price > y_test[i]:  # Buy Signal
        position = capital / y_test[i]
        capital = 0
    elif predicted_price < y_test[i] and position > 0:  # Sell Signal
        capital = position * y_test[i]
        position = 0

final_value = capital if capital > 0 else position * y_test[-1]
print(f"Final Portfolio Value: {final_value}")
```

This evaluates how the model performs in a simulated trading environment.

6. Deploying in a Real-Time Trading Environment

Once the model is trained, we can deploy it in a live trading environment using the Binance WebSocket API.

6.1. Streaming Real-Time Data

```py
from binance import ThreadedWebsocketManager

def handle_message(msg):
    close_price = float(msg["k"]["c"])  # Latest closing price
    print(f"BTCUSDT Close Price: {close_price}")

twm = ThreadedWebsocketManager(api_key=api_key, api_secret=api_secret)
twm.start()
twm.start_kline_socket(callback=handle_message, symbol="BTCUSDT", interval="1m")
```

6.2. Executing Trades

```py
def place_order(side, quantity):
    order = client.order_market(symbol="BTCUSDT", side=side, quantity=quantity)
    print(f"Order placed: {order}")

if predicted_price > close_price:
    place_order("BUY", 0.01)
elif predicted_price < close_price:
    place_order("SELL", 0.01)
```

This executes trades based on live predictions.
